Files in this directory have been automatically generated
and are not supposed to be modified, but I'm just a text
file I have no control over you.

The reasons why these files are on git are:

  - CI build job crashes due to an OOM condition.
  - In the future, if we make some changes to the
    code generators, we may want to have something
    to compare against.
